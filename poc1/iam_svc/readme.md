## The IAM Service

This is the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, playing the authentication server role, thus being responsible with authenticating users and returing JWTs containing claims with relevant details.

### Run

Use the standard `go run ./cmd/main.go` approach.

For the flags options, run `go run ./cmd/main.go -h`.
